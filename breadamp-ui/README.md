# breadamp-ui

This is a user interface which can control the MIDI light show.

## CLI Commands

Most importantly, for now:

```sh
# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
preact watch
```

Also:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and preact-render-spy
npm run test
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [CLI Readme](https://github.com/developit/preact-cli/blob/master/README.md).
